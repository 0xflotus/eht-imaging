PolMEM
==================================
A python package for generating polarimetric VLBI datasets and producing images with a variety of "Maximum Entropy" algorithms.

The three main classes are the :class:`Image`, :class:`Array`, and :class:`Obsdata`. ``maxen.py`` contains a variety of different imaging algorithms that typically take an :class:`Obsdata` object and initial/prior :class:`Image` as input and return another :class:`Image` object.
