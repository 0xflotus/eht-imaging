PolMEM
============

Python modules for simulating and manipulating VLBI data and producing polarimetric images with Maximum Entropy methods. This version represents a very early release so please submit a pull request or email achael@cfa.harvard.edu if you have trouble or
need help for your application.

oifits_new.py code for writing/reading oifits files is a slightly modified version of Paul Boley's package at http://astro.ins.urfu.ru/pages/~pboley/oifits/ The oifits read/write functionality is still being tested and may not work with all versions of python or astropy.io.fits.
